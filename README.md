# automated_chrome
I used this piece of code to open and close a link again and again.
<br>
We need to install selenium to gain access to our browser to control it automatically.
<br>
You can install selenium by <br> pip install selenium<br>
The other thing that we require is driver for browser. In this code i used chrome, any browser will do the job</br>
Drivers can be downloaded from http://seleniumhq.org </br>
Now we are good to go !!
